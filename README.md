1.Database Summary Report

Liverpool Football Club.

Liverpool Football Club is one of the most successful and globally recognized football clubs, competing in the English Premier League. The club manages a large roster of professional players, coaches, medical staff, scouts, and administrative personnel. They operate out of Anfield as their home stadium and train at the AXA Training Centre. To maintain elite performance, Liverpool FC relies on detailed tracking of player performance, match statistics, training schedules, staff roles, and injuries.

Managing this information manually or across scattered documents creates inefficiencies. The club needs accurate, centralized information that coaches, analysts, and staff can use to make informed decisions. A relational database allows Liverpool FC to store mission-critical information in an organized, secure, and queryable way.

How Users Will Use the Database   

Coaches will use the database to view player details, check fitness status, track match performance, review goals and assists, and access training attendance. Analysts will use the database to run queries about match statistics, player availability, and performance trends. The medical team will manage injury histories and expected recovery dates. Administrative staff will add new players, schedule matches, and maintain staff records.

End users will interact with the database through SQL queries, views, and dashboards connected to applications or reporting tools. They will perform routine operations such as inserting match results, updating injuries, accessing performance reports, and reviewing roster changes. The database serves as a unified system supporting the entire professional football operations of Liverpool FC.
